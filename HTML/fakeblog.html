      <h2> All About Me </h2>
      <p> I'm just an aspiring developer who loves <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rickandmortyrickstaverse/?hl=en">Rick and Morty</a>. Enjoy this lorem ipsum Rick and Morty:</p>
      <p> I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to, grab him and, stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?!
          They're robots Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're just robots! There is no god, Summer; gotta rip that band-aid off now you'll thank me later.</p>
      <p> You know what a vole is, Morty? You know what a vole is? Well look where being smart got you. Whoa, spoilers! I'm a whole season behind. Your failures are your own,
          old man! I say, follow throooough!</p>
      <p> This is because you give Morty Smith bad grades, bitch! Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of them, Rick! What is this, 90's Conan? That just sounds
          like slavery with extra steps. </p>
      <p> Pluto's a planet. Oh, we're welllll past that, Jerry! Awww, it's you guys! My name is Slip- Slippery Stair. I'll take ya down there for 25 shmeckels! </p>
      <p> "Quantum carburetor"? Jesus, Morty. You can't just add a Sci-Fi word to a car word and hope it means somethingâ€¦ Huh, looks like something's wrong with the
          microverse battery. We're gonna have to go inside. Meeseeks don't usually have to exist for this long. It's gettin' weeeiiird. We are created to serve a singular purpose,
          for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill! Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh yeah you can't. They blew up.</p>
